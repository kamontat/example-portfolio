This example of React Static includes a demonstration on how to import your own dynamic components that will be statically rendered (SSR) in addition to being code-split.

* Babel
* CSS imports
* Image imports
* File imports
* Automatic Routing
* Runtime Code Splitting
* Server Side Rendering of Code Split Components

To get started, run `react-static create` and use the `dynamic-imports` template.
